DLang is development suite for the "DumbLang" - The Dumb Programming Language.  The suite contains a compiler, an interpreter (vm)
and an IDE that allows compilation and execution of DumbLang programs.  The reason the language is called DumbLang is that all
it currently supports is arithmetic expressions.
